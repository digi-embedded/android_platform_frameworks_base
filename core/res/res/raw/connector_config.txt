#   - static        Device ID will be manually specified in the 'device_id' setting.
#   - network       Device ID will be auto-generated and saved using active interface.
#   - provisioning  Device ID will be provisioned from Device Cloud using the Vendor ID
#                   number set in the 'vendor_id' setting.

# provisioning. It can be obtained under 'Admin > Account Settings > My Account >
